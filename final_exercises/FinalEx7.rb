# An array is used to organize information into an ordered list. The list can be made up of strings, integers, floats, booleans, or any other data type. In Ruby, an array is denoted by square brackets [ ]. Inside the brackets you can create a list of elements separated by commas. 

# A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys. Where arrays, stores items by an ordered index. Entries in a hash are often referred to as key-value pairs.  Hashes are denoted with curly braces.
